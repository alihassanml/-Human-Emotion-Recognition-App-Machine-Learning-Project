# Human Motion Detection App using Machine Learning

This project aims to develop a human motion detection application using machine learning techniques. The application will be able to detect and classify human motions based on input data, such as sensor readings or video feeds.

## Overview
Human motion detection is an essential task in various fields, including security, healthcare, and sports analytics. Traditional methods for motion detection often rely on complex algorithms and heuristics. In contrast, this project utilizes machine learning algorithms to automate the process.

## Libraries Used
- Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- NumPy: For numerical computing.
- Matplotlib and Seaborn: For data visualization.
- NLTK: For natural language processing tasks (if needed).
- WordCloud: For generating word clouds (if needed).
- Scikit-learn: For machine learning algorithms implementation, including:
  - Train-test split.
  - Feature extraction using TF-IDF vectorization.
  - Evaluation metrics such as accuracy score and classification report.
  - Algorithms like Random Forest Classifier, Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machine (SVM).

## Workflow
1. **Data Collection**: Gather data relevant to human motion. This could be sensor data from accelerometers, gyroscopes, or video data.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean the data, handle missing values, and convert it into a format suitable for machine learning models.
3. **Feature Extraction**: Extract relevant features from the data. This could involve techniques such as TF-IDF vectorization for text data or feature engineering for sensor data.
4. **Model Building**: Train machine learning models using the preprocessed data. Experiment with various algorithms like Random Forest, Naive Bayes, and SVM to find the best-performing model.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the models using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
6. **Deployment**: Deploy the trained model into the application, allowing real-time or batch processing of input data to detect human motions.
